  **Background:** People who use opioids from an unregulated drug supply are increasingly exposed to related adverse social and health outcomes. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is effective in mitigating adverse outcomes, with individual preference identified as key to enhancing treatment. We examined OAT preferences and associated factors in a national sample of people who regularly use opioids. **Methods:** In this cross-sectional study, 400 people were enrolled between October 2020-April 2021. Participants completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire with questions on sociodemographic, behavioural, drug use- and treatment-related characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate factors associated with treatment preferences. **Results:** Among all participants (mean age 45, 42% female), X%  preferred OAT, with X% and X% reporting a preference for methadone and buprenorphine respectively. who reported a preference for OAT, X% (n=X) preferred metahdone, while X% (n=X) preferred buprenorphine. participants who preferred methadone were more likely to have ever received OAT with methadone, and had used heroin (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) and other pharmaceutical opioids in the past month(aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX). Participants who preferred buprenorphine were more likely to have ever received OAT with burpenorphine (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX). Among participants currently on OAT (n=317), X% in receipt of methadone and X% of buprenorphine were prescribed their preferred medication. Participants who preferred methadone were more likely to be receiving OAT with the same medication (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX), had used and heroin (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) and other pharmaceutical opioids in the prior month (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX). Participants who preferred buprenorphine were more likely to be currently receiving burpenorphine (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX). **Conclusions:** Among people who regularly used opioids, most preferred to receive OAT with methadone and those currently receiving OAT were prescribed their preferred medication. Providers that do not offer a range of OAT and restrict choice of preferred medication risk negatively impacting treatment outcomes.

plain-language-summary: |
  In a national sample of people who regularly use opioids, most preferred OAT with methadone. These participants were more likely to have ever received methadone, and have previously used heroin or non-prescrived pharmaceuticals. Among participants currently receiving OAT, almost all were receiving their preferred therapy.
key-points:
  - From our sample of people who regularly use opioids from around Australia. most preferred to receive opioid agonist therapy with methadone.
  - Current OAT participants (n=317) comprised 78% (n=x) on methadone and 91% (n=x) on buprenorphine, with 78% (n=x) and 91% (n=x) receiving their preferred medication reservoirs.

## Introduction

People who use opioids from the unregulated market are increasingly
exposed to related social and health harms [@milaneyscoping2022;
@cheethamimpact2022], including fatal and non-fatal opioid-involved
overdose [@santo2021; @åstrøm2023], incarceration [@gisev2019;
@fazel2017], stigma [@treloar2022b] and structural violence
[@lancaster2023a]. Use via injection is associated is several health
risks [@brener2022; @colledge2019; @degenhardt2019] such as increased
risk of HIV and HCV infection [@Grebely2022; @Martinello2017a;
@hajarizadeh], skin and soft tissue infection [@wheeler2022] and
endocarditis [@wurcel2016; @see2020]. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) with
methadone and buprenorphine is effective in reducing associated harms
[@degenhardt2023; @Nielsen2016; @Nielsen2022; @Jones2022], with
retention associated with improved social and health outcomes , and
reduced quality-adjusted life-years lost compared to no treatment or
non-pharmacological interventions [@martin2022]. Despite the efficacy of
these medications [@degenhardt2023], treatment acceptability,
satisfaction, and retention is sub-optimal, globally. Individual
preferences for these medications play a pivotal role in determining
positive treatment outcomes [@joosten2008]. With similar outcomes for a
range of measures among particular subgroups between medications
[@degenhardt2023], the choice between methadone and buprenorphine should
be informed by consultation with each person after consideration of
preferences and the relative risks and benefits of each medication to
the indivudal. While a number of studies explore the role of treatment
preferences generally [@uebelacker2016], relatively fewer number of
studies focus specifically on factors associated with preferences for
medication types [@kenney2018] and modes of delivery [@allen2023].

Preferences around OAT and individual choice are identified as key to
improving treatment outcomes and reducing potential harms associated
with use of unregulated opioids [@muthulingam2023]. Preferences are
comprised of attitudes, beliefs, expectations, values, and processes
used to evaluate the costs and benefits of treatment options
[@montori2013], with the decision for one formulation over another being
largely preference sensitive [@keirns2009]. Understanding treatment
preference could inform shared decision-making and help to overcome
barriers to effective, person-centered healthcare and support
[@maddensatisfaction2008]. However, about how opioid-dependent patients'
preferences and previous experiences influence treatment decisions.
Preferences, perceptions and acceptability of medication formulations
vary widely based on each participant's individual experiences, goals,
and values [@neale2018; @nealequalitative2023; @nealedepot2019].
Previous studies exploring preferences for methadone and buprenorphine
have beenStudies have compared patients' views of methadone with
buprenorphine [@hillcomparison2015]. However, findings have been
inconsistent and variable [@whitepatients2007]. Previous Studies into
treatment preferences carried out in the United Kingdom [@neale2018;
@tompkinsopioid2019], France [@rolland2021], North America
[@saunders2020], and Australia [@larance2020] suggest that preferences
for OAT is influenced by a range of physical, psychological and social
factors [@lancaster2023]. Additional studies have explored preferences
generally, however, understanding of factors that influence and
contribute to stated preference are limited. Limitations of previous
studies include limited geographic scope with samples from single
clinics (e.g.[@bailey2013]) or cities (e.g.[@luty2004]), and relatively
small samples and lack of power to investigate factors associated with
OAT preferences (e.g. [@ridge2009]).

In Australia, there are several formulations of buprenorphine currently
available, including a monobuprenorphine formulation (Subutex) and
buprenorphine-- naloxone formulations in a tablet or film and
administered sublingually (Suboxone), and, more recently, long-acting
injectable formulations that are administered once-weekly or
once-monthly, dpending on the product (Buivdal and Sublocade). There are
variations in OAT provision between jurisdictions due to decentralized
funding of health services and the varied historical contexts across the
country [@hall2023]. In some jurisdictions, OAT is dispensed exclusively
at community pharmacies, while others have a mix of community pharmacy
and public clinics. Community pharmacies offer longer opening hours and
more accessible locations than public clinics, yet the out-of-pocket
dispensing fees at pharmacy can make OAT prohibitively expensive
[@tran2022; @zahra2022]. Historically, provision of OAT has been
considered complex given its strict regulatory oversight and varied
interpretation of guidelines among OAT prescribers. Despite providers
differing in their interpretation of guidelines, OAT provision in
Australia has been criticised for its rigidity in not adapting to the
needs of people engaged in treatment [@crawfordshouting2013]. Many
aspects of OAT provision also lack flexibility, and are often not
person-centered, with limited access to unsupervised dosing and
restrictive dosing times, which cumulatively decrease treatment
adhearance [@hall2023]. It is important to understand preferences for
the available medications to inform person-centered OAT provision and
enhance treatment outcomes.

Accessibility and diversity of OAT need to be enhanced to ensure that
all people can receive their preferred OAT. Improved understanding of
preference and factors associated with a preference for OAT preference
is needed to inform policy and service provision. information on
preference for different OAT options has shown to enhance patient
acceptability, leading to increased OAT treatment uptake, adherence, and
retention to improve clinical utility and facilitate planning,
prioritization and investment in national strategies and
guidelines.Extensive literature on patient participation in medication
decision-making emphasizes that incorporating patient treatment
preference leads to higher rates of retention and the desired outcomes
[@friedrichs2016; @joosten2008]. Providers incorporating client
preferences into treatment is linked to increased satisfaction, with
individual choice, with alignment with preferred therapy leading to
improved outcomes [@fallah2015; @joosten2008]. To better understand
treatment preferences and develop an evidence-base to inform policy and
treatment service design and delivery, we examined OAT preferences and
associated factors among a national sample of people who regularly use
opioids in Australia.

### Study design and participants {#sec-study-design}

Enhancing Treatment of Hepatitis C in Opioid Substitution Settings (ETHOS) Engage is a national observational cohort study of people who have a history of injecting drug use, and report injecting drug use in the preceding six months or are currently receiving OAT (either methadone, buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone or long-acting injectable buprenorphine in Australia). The study procedures have been described in detail elsewhere (Valerio et al., 2020). Participants were enrolled across two recruitment waves. During Wave 1 (May 2018- September 2019) recruitment occurred in 25 sites, including drug treatment clinics (n = 21) and needle and syringe programs (NSPs) (n = 4). Following Wave I, the study protocol and questionnaire was ammended to include questions around preferences for opioid agonist therapy and associated factors. Following this, only participants receruited in Wave II are included in this analyses and individuals who were enrolled within and between Wave 1 and Wave 2 were identified by two-by-two name code (first two letters of first name and last name) and date of birth included. During Wave 2 (November 2019-June 2021), participants were recruited from 21 of the 25 sites which participated in Wave 1, including drug treatment clinics (n = 19) and NSPs (n = 2) in New South Wales ( n = 17), Queensland (n = 4), South Australia (n = 2) and Western Australia ( n = 2) (@fig-map). The content within this article is presented following the 'Strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology'(STROBE) guidelines [@von2007; @Vandenbroucke2007]. A completed checklist of the STROBE requirements is available in the @sec-supp-material.

Inclusion criteria were informed consent, age >18 years, and injecting drug use, either within the previous six months or lifetime history and current OAT. Due to contraindications with Fibroscan®, people who were pregnant were excluded from Wave The study protocol was amended for Wave 2 to include pregnant participants (FibroScan® was withheld for those individuals). The first enrolment was used for all participants who participated more than once within each recruitment wave. The initial study protocol and amendments were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at St Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney (HREC Ref: HREC/17/SVH/113) and the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council (HREC Ref: 1279/17).

### Procedures {#sec-procedures}

ETHOS Engage was advertised preceding recruitment with posters, cards distributed with sterile injecting equipment from NSPs and by word of mouth, but service staff were not directly involved in recruitment. Recruitment spanned one to five days per site and included a team of peers, university staff, and clinic personnel. Campaign days were run in multiple stages. First, participants provided 100μl finger-stick capillary whole-blood to test for HCV RNA using the point-of-care Xpert HCV Viral Load Fingerstick Assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, United States; lower limit of quantification 100IU/ml, upper limit of quantification log10 IU/ml; 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity) (Lamoury et al. 2018).Procedures are described in detail in Valerio (2021). Participants then self-completed a computer tablet-based questionnaire collecting demographics, behavioural risk, and HCV history, OAT preferences, drug use characteristics and drug treatment history. All participants were reimbursed (AUD$30 voucher) for their time and out-of-pocket expenses.

### Outcomes {#sec-outcomes}

The primary outcome was a preference for opioid agonist therapy, which was assessed by asking the question "*Of all the following types of medications used for opioid agonist therapy, if you could choose today, which one would you prefer?*" Options included methadone, monobuprenorphine (Subutex), buprenorphine-naloxone
(Suboxone) taken orally as a film or tablet, long acting injectable
buprenorphine (Buvidal or Sublocade), any treatment (i.e. no preference
for any medication), and no treatment.

Frequencies and percentages were generated from responses. 
Demographic, behavioural, and clinical factors hypothesised to be associated with preference to receive OAT treatment were determined were determined through consultation with people who use drugs and previous research that looked into factors associated with OAT preferences (e.g. Stowe et al. 2023 in press; Larance et al. 2020; Rolland et al. 2019; 2021priori, comprising the following: 1) age at survey (18 - 29; 30 – 39; 40 – 49; > 50 years old) ), 2) gender (female; male; transgender), 3) education (< year 10; > year 10), 4) employment (formal; informal), 5) homelessness (yes; no), 6) incarceration history (never, >1 year ago, within the last year), 7) recency and frequency of injection drug use (>1 year ago, within 1–12 months ago, within the last month less than daily, and daily or more), 8) drugs injected in the last month (none, heroin, other opioids, methamphetamine, other), 9) previous OAT (yes; no), 10) previous OAT with methadone (yes; no); and 11) previous OAT with buprenorphine (yes; no). Among those currently receiving OAT, factors included 1) current OAT medication (methadone; buprenorphine; buprenorphine-naloxone; long acting depot buprenorphine; none) and current dosages (mg).

6 The exposure of interest was recruitment Wave (Wave 1, May 2018 – September 2019; Wave
7 2, November 2019 – June 2021). Other demographic and behavioural factors hypothesised to
8 be associated with current HCV infection and HCV treatment were determined using
9 previously published ETHOS Engage Wave 1 results (Valerio et al. 2021c) and included: (i)
10 age at survey (stratified around median), (ii) gender (male, female, other [non11
binary/transgender/other]), (iii) Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, (iv) homelessness, (v)
12 OAT status (never, past, within the last month/current), (vi) incarceration history (never,
13 history only [not recent], recent [previous 12 months in Wave 1 and previous six months in
14 Wave 2]), (vii) recency and frequency of injecting drug use (>1 year ago, within the previous
15 1-12 months, within the previous month <daily, and >daily). In analyses among those with
16 injecting drug use in the previous month, injecting-related exposure variables were recoded as
17 recency of injecting (<daily, >daily) and main drug injected in the last month was assessed
18 (heroin, other opioids, methamphetamine, other).

### Statistical analysis {#sec-analysis}

The proportion of people who reported preference for methadone and
factors associated with this preference was assessed. Quantitative
parameters are presented as the median and interquartile range \[IQR\].
Categorical parameters are presented as the number and percentage (n;
%). The association between the response to each variable and the
binarized category of preference for methadone was explored using
logistic regression modeling through unadjusted bivariate analysis,
providing an odds ratio and the 95 % confidence interval (OR \[95%
CI\]), and comparisons adjusted for age category and gender, providing
an adjusted OR (aOR) and the 95 % CI. A sample of those who would choose
treatment and who had a preference for methadone or any buprenorphine
forumation was selected for analysis (n=352) . Multivariable logistic
regression was used assess factors associated with preferred medication
for OAT. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were derived using logistic
regression and 95% confidence intervals calculated for all variables.
For the final model, all the explanatory variables significantly
associated with the outcome in the bivariate models were included in the
multivariable model, whilst also adjusting for age and gender. The final
model was assessed through examining which contributed significantly to
model fit through backwards selection using decreasing values of Akaike
Information Criterion. The variance inflation factor was used to assess
collinearity in the final model [@obrien2007]. Individuals with missing
values were not integrated in the models. A subset of the sample
comprising of participants currently receiving OAT with methadone and
buprenorphine (including sublingual-monobuprenorphine,
buprenorphine-naloxone and long-acting injectable buprenorphine) was
selected for analysis. There was no formal sample size calculation,
however, based of similar previous surveys (e.g. [@larance2020;
@rolland2021]) we aimed to recruit 300 - 400 people.

The analytical approach received input from and was reviewed by people
who use drugs, with lived- and living-experience of injecting drug use and opioid
agonist therapy with various formulations of methadone and
buprenorphine. Advice and perspectives were provided on the inclusion of
explanatory variables and the clinical and practical significance of
identified factors.

The analysis was undertaken in using `R` version

### Participant Characteristics {#sec-participants}

Overall, XXX participants were enrolled (@fig-profile). The median age
was XX years, XX% (n=XXX) were female, XX% (n=XX) incarcerated in the
last six months and XX% (n=XX) were currently living with chronic pain
(@tbl-participants).

At enrollment, XX% (n=XX) had injected drugs in the month prior, with
45% (n=141 of 310) having injected drugs \>daily. Most participants were
treatment experienced (n = 344; 87%), with 91% (n=X) with most having
received methadone (n = 319; 91%) compared to buprenorphine (n = 344;
87%) (@tbl-s1). Among those who injected, commonly injected drugs in the
prior month included heroin (90%), non-prescribed methadone (13%%),
non-prescribed buprenorphine (10%), other non-prescribed pharmaceutical
opioids (X%), methamphetamine (X%), cocaine (X%) and benzodiazepines
(X%)

Of the participants currently receiving OAT, XX% (n=XX) were prescribed
methadone, XX% (n=XX) buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone), XX% (n=XX)
long-acting injectable buprenorphine (Buivdal or Sublocade) 3% (n=9),
buprenorphine (Subutex) and X% (n=X) were not in treatment. Among those
receving treatment, most collected their last dose at pharmacies XX% (n=XX) or public clinics (n=111; 35%), with just over half (n=177; 56%)
travelling less than five kilometers (@tbl-s2).

### Preferences for OAT {#sec-preferences}

Among all participants (n=X), X% (n=xx) would prefer to receive OAT,
with XX% (n=XX) preferring either methadone or any formulation of
buprenorphine and XX% (n=XX) choosing treatment, but having no preferred
medication. Methadone was preferred by XX% (n=XX) and buprenorphine by
XX% (n=XX).Among those who preferred buprenorphine, sublingual
buprenorphine-naloxone was preferred by XX% (n=XX) and long-acting
injectable buprenorphine by XX% (n=XX). A summary of sociodemographic
characteristics stratified by preference is presented in @tbl-s1. Among
participants currently receiving XX% (n=XX), XX% (n=XX) preferred
either oral methadone or any formulation of buprenorphine, XX% (n=XX)
would choose treatment, but had no preferred medications and XX% (n=XX)
would prefer not to receive treatment. Methadone was preferred by 60%
XX% (n=XX), oral and sublingual by XX% (n=XX) and long-acting injectable
buprenorphine by XX% (n=XX). A summary of sociodemographic
characteristics of people currently receiving OAT stratified by
preference is presented in @tbl-s2.

### Factors associated with OAT preference {#sec-factors}

Overall, participants who preferred methadone were more likely to have
ever received OAT with methadone, and had used heroin (aOR X.XX,
95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) and other pharmaceutical opioids in the month prior
(aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) (@fig-forest). Participants who preferred
buprenorphine were more likely to have ever received OAT with
burpenorphine (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX).

Participants who were currently receiving OAT and who preferred
methadone were more likely to have ever received OAT with methadone, and
had used heroin (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) and other pharmaceutical
opioids in the past month (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) (@fig-forest).
Participants who preferred buprenorphine were more likely to have ever
received OAT with burpenorphine (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX).

## Discussion



### Limitations

There are several limitations of the study to consider. Data comprising
the study arise from cross sectional survey design and convenience
sampling of harm reduction sites and voluntary participation of
individuals within those sites, therefore these findings may not be
generalizable to all people who use drugs. Study sites did not routinely
collect information about numbers examined for eligibility, confirmed
eligible and included in the study, and we are unable to report these
details. However, the demographic characteristics of the current study's
sample are consistent with those of other large Australian studies of
people who are regularly use opioids (i.e. the majority male, typically
aged early 40s, with the majority of OAT clients receiving methadone)
Most of the sample were treatment experienced having ever received treatment
with methadone (n=) or buprenorphine (n=x), and therefore, there was
limited input from participants who had never previously sought
treatment. Despite this, there is still a need to ensure that those
currently receiving OAT are prescribed their preferred medication, and
to understand preferences of those interersted in OAT to enhance
treatment and improve overall satisfaction. In addition, although most
participants preferred treatment with a particular medication (n=366),
the sample of participants preferring sublingual buprenorphine (n=68)
and long-acting injectable bupenorphine (n=68) was relatively small,
limiting the statistical power to detect differences and
representativeness. A larger and more diverse sample would enhance the
study's reliability and enable more robust analysis. The survey's
self-report nature may introduce bias, as participants' preferences
might not fully align with their actual experiences with these
medications.In addition, this study was conducted prior to the
widespread implementation of long-acting injectable formulations of
buprenorphine and participants were therefore largely unfamiliar to
people receiving OAT. The lack of familiarity with these formulations is
a potential source of bias as participants were reporting on
hypothetical scenarios and anticipated preferences, benefits and
disadvantages. Despite these limitations, this study provides important
insights into preferred treatment and medications.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this study provides valuable insight into medication
preferences among people who regularly use opioids. Methadone was
preferred over any available formulation of buprenorphine by the
participants, where as similar number of participants preferred
sublingual and long-acting injectable formulations of buprenorphine.
Most those receiving treatment were prescribed their preferred
medication, with previous treatment experience the strongest predictor
of medication preference. Australian OAT guidelines recommend that
client preferences are taken into account in choosing medications. These
findings may act as a guide for those discussions that are had on an
individual basis. Clinical decision making around treatment options must
centre individual preference and balance suitability and choice of
treatment.
