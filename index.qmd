  **Background:** People who use opioids from an unregulated drug supply are increasingly exposed to related adverse social and health outcomes. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is effective in mitigating adverse outcomes, with individual preference identified as key to enhancing treatment.

plain-language-summary: |
  In a national sample of people who regularly use opioids, most preferred OAT with methadone. These participants were more likely to have ever received methadone, and have previously used heroin or non-prescrived pharmaceuticals. Among participants currently receiving OAT, almost all were receiving their preferred therapy.

### Study design and participants {#sec-study-design}

Enhancing Treatment of Hepatitis C in Opioid Substitution Settings
(ETHOS) Engage is a national observational cohort study of people who
have a history of injecting drug use, and report injecting drug use in
the preceding six months or are currently receiving OAT (either
methadone, buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone or long-acting
injectable buprenorphine in Australia). The study procedures have been
described in detail elsewhere (Valerio et al., 2020). Participants were
enrolled across two recruitment waves. During Wave 1 (May 2018-
September 2019) recruitment occurred in 25 sites, including drug
treatment clinics (n = 21) and needle and syringe programs (NSPs) (n =
4). Following Wave I, the study protocol and questionnaire was ammended
to include questions around preferences for opioid agonist therapy and
associated factors. Following this, only participants receruited in Wave
II are included in this analyses and individuals who were enrolled
within and between Wave 1 and Wave 2 were identified by two-by-two name
code (first two letters of first name and last name) and date of birth
included. During Wave 2 (November 2019-June 2021), participants were
recruited from 21 of the 25 sites which participated in Wave 1,
including drug treatment clinics (n = 19) and NSPs (n = 2) in New South
Wales ( n = 17), Queensland (n = 4), South Australia (n = 2) and Western
Australia ( n = 2) (@fig-map). The content within this article is
presented following the 'Strengthening the reporting of observational
studies in epidemiology'(STROBE) guidelines [@von2007;
@Vandenbroucke2007]. A completed checklist of the STROBE requirements is
available in the @sec-supp-material.

Inclusion criteria were informed consent, age \>18 years, and injecting
drug use, either within the previous six months or lifetime history and
current OAT. Due to contraindications with Fibroscan®, people who were
pregnant were excluded from Wave The study protocol was amended for Wave
2 to include pregnant participants (FibroScan® was withheld for those
individuals). The first enrolment was used for all participants who
participated more than once within each recruitment wave. The initial
study protocol and amendments were approved by the Human Research Ethics
Committees at St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney (HREC Ref: HREC/17/SVH/113)
and the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council (HREC Ref:
1279/17).

### Procedures {#sec-procedures}

ETHOS Engage was advertised preceding recruitment with posters, cards
distributed with sterile injecting equipment from NSPs and by word of
mouth, but service staff were not directly involved in recruitment.
Recruitment spanned one to five days per site and included a team of
peers, university staff, and clinic personnel. Campaign days were run in
multiple stages. First, participants provided 100μl finger-stick
capillary whole-blood to test for HCV RNA using the point-of-care Xpert
HCV Viral Load Fingerstick Assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, United States;
lower limit of quantification 100IU/ml, upper limit of quantification
log10 IU/ml; 100% sensitivity, 100% specificity) (Lamoury et al.
2018).Procedures are described in detail in Valerio (2021). Participants
then self-completed a computer tablet-based questionnaire collecting
demographics, behavioural risk, and HCV history, OAT preferences, drug
use characteristics and drug treatment history. All participants were
reimbursed (AUD\$30 voucher) for their time and out-of-pocket expenses.

### Outcomes {#sec-outcomes}

The primary outcome was a preference for opioid agonist therapy, which
was assessed by asking the question "*Of all the following types of
medications used for opioid agonist therapy, if you could choose today,
which one would you prefer?*" Options included methadone,
monobuprenorphine (Subutex), buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone) taken
orally as a film or tablet, long acting injectable buprenorphine
(Buvidal or Sublocade), any treatment (i.e. no preference for any
medication), and no treatment.

Frequencies and percentages were generated from responses. Demographic,
behavioural, and clinical factors hypothesised to be associated with
preference to receive OAT treatment were determined were determined
through consultation with people who use drugs and previous research
that looked into factors associated with OAT preferences (e.g. Stowe et
al. 2023 in press; Larance et al. 2020; Rolland et al. 2019; 2021priori,
comprising the following: 1) age at survey (18 - 29; 30 -- 39; 40 -- 49;
\> 50 years old) ), 2) gender (female; male; transgender), 3) education
(\< year 10; \> year 10), 4) employment (formal; informal), 5)
homelessness (yes; no), 6) incarceration history (never, \>1 year ago,
within the last year), 7) recency and frequency of injection drug use
(\>1 year ago, within 1--12 months ago, within the last month less than
daily, and daily or more), 8) drugs injected in the last month (none,
heroin, other opioids, methamphetamine, other), 9) previous OAT (yes;
no), 10) previous OAT with methadone (yes; no); and 11) previous OAT
with buprenorphine (yes; no). Among those currently receiving OAT,
factors included 1) current OAT medication (methadone; buprenorphine;
buprenorphine-naloxone; long acting depot buprenorphine; none) and
current dosages (mg).

6 The exposure of interest was recruitment Wave (Wave 1, May 2018 --
September 2019; Wave 7 2, November 2019 -- June 2021). Other demographic
and behavioural factors hypothesised to 8 be associated with current HCV
infection and HCV treatment were determined using 9 previously published
ETHOS Engage Wave 1 results (Valerio et al. 2021c) and included: (i) 10
age at survey (stratified around median), (ii) gender (male, female,
other \[non11 binary/transgender/other\]), (iii) Aboriginal or Torres
Strait Islander, (iv) homelessness, (v) 12 OAT status (never, past,
within the last month/current), (vi) incarceration history (never, 13
history only \[not recent\], recent \[previous 12 months in Wave 1 and
previous six months in 14 Wave 2\]), (vii) recency and frequency of
injecting drug use (\>1 year ago, within the previous 15 1-12 months,
within the previous month \<daily, and \>daily). In analyses among those
with 16 injecting drug use in the previous month, injecting-related
exposure variables were recoded as 17 recency of injecting (\<daily,
\>daily) and main drug injected in the last month was assessed 18
(heroin, other opioids, methamphetamine, other).

### Statistical analysis {#sec-analysis}

The proportion of people who reported preference for methadone and
factors associated with this preference was assessed. Quantitative
parameters are presented as the median and interquartile range \[IQR\].
Categorical parameters are presented as the number and percentage (n;
%). The association between the response to each variable and the
binarized category of preference for methadone was explored using
logistic regression modeling through unadjusted bivariate analysis,
providing an odds ratio and the 95 % confidence interval (OR \[95%
CI\]), and comparisons adjusted for age category and gender, providing
an adjusted OR (aOR) and the 95 % CI. A sample of those who would choose
treatment and who had a preference for methadone or any buprenorphine
forumation was selected for analysis (n=352) . Multivariable logistic
regression was used assess factors associated with preferred medication
for OAT. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were derived using logistic
regression and 95% confidence intervals calculated for all variables.
For the final model, all the explanatory variables significantly
associated with the outcome in the bivariate models were included in the
multivariable model, whilst also adjusting for age and gender. The final
model was assessed through examining which contributed significantly to
model fit through backwards selection using decreasing values of Akaike
Information Criterion. The variance inflation factor was used to assess
collinearity in the final model [@obrien2007]. Individuals with missing
values were not integrated in the models. A subset of the sample
comprising of participants currently receiving OAT with methadone and
buprenorphine (including sublingual-monobuprenorphine,
buprenorphine-naloxone and long-acting injectable buprenorphine) was
selected for analysis. There was no formal sample size calculation,
however, based of similar previous surveys (e.g. [@larance2020;
@rolland2021]) we aimed to recruit 300 - 400 people.

The analytical approach received input from and was reviewed by people
who use drugs, with lived- and living-experience of injecting drug use
and opioid agonist therapy with various formulations of methadone and
buprenorphine. Advice and perspectives were provided on the inclusion of
explanatory variables and the clinical and practical significance of
identified factors.

The analysis was undertaken in using `R` version @stats using the
following packages: gtsummary v. 1.7.2 [@gtsummary], quarto v. 1.3
[@quarto]. The code for this analysis is available on request from the
corresponding author. The data supporting the findings of this study are
available within the article and its Supporting information. The
analysis was not pre-registered and the results should be considered
exploratory.

### Study oversight {#sec-oversight}

### Participant Characteristics {#sec-participants}

Overall, XXX participants were enrolled (@fig-profile). The median age
was XX years, XX% (n=XXX) were female, XX% (n=XX) incarcerated in the
last six months and XX% (n=XX) were currently living with chronic pain
(@tbl-participants).

At enrollment, XX% (n=XX) had injected drugs in the month prior, with
45% (n=141 of 310) having injected drugs \>daily. Most participants were
treatment experienced (n = 344; 87%), with 91% (n=X) with most having
received methadone (n = 319; 91%) compared to buprenorphine (n = 344;
87%) (@tbl-s1). Among those who injected, commonly injected drugs in the
prior month included heroin (90%), non-prescribed methadone (13%%),
non-prescribed buprenorphine (10%), other non-prescribed pharmaceutical
opioids (X%), methamphetamine (X%), cocaine (X%) and benzodiazepines
(X%)

Of the participants currently receiving OAT, XX% (n=XX) were prescribed
methadone, XX% (n=XX) buprenorphine-naloxone (Suboxone), XX% (n=XX)
long-acting injectable buprenorphine (Buivdal or Sublocade) 3% (n=9),
buprenorphine (Subutex) and X% (n=X) were not in treatment. Among those
receving treatment, most collected their last dose at pharmacies XX%
(n=XX) or public clinics (n=111; 35%), with just over half (n=177; 56%)
travelling less than five kilometers (@tbl-s2).

### Preferences for OAT {#sec-preferences}

Among all participants (n=X), X% (n=xx) would prefer to receive OAT,
with XX% (n=XX) preferring either methadone or any formulation of
buprenorphine and XX% (n=XX) choosing treatment, but having no preferred
medication. Methadone was preferred by XX% (n=XX) and buprenorphine by
XX% (n=XX).Among those who preferred buprenorphine, sublingual
buprenorphine-naloxone was preferred by XX% (n=XX) and long-acting
injectable buprenorphine by XX% (n=XX). A summary of sociodemographic
characteristics stratified by preference is presented in @tbl-s1. Among
participants currently receiving XX% (n=XX), XX% (n=XX) preferred either
oral methadone or any formulation of buprenorphine, XX% (n=XX) would
choose treatment, but had no preferred medications and XX% (n=XX) would
prefer not to receive treatment. Methadone was preferred by 60% XX%
(n=XX), oral and sublingual by XX% (n=XX) and long-acting injectable
buprenorphine by XX% (n=XX). A summary of sociodemographic
characteristics of people currently receiving OAT stratified by
preference is presented in @tbl-s2.

### Factors associated with OAT preference {#sec-factors}

Overall, participants who preferred methadone were more likely to have
ever received OAT with methadone, and had used heroin (aOR X.XX,
95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) and other pharmaceutical opioids in the month prior
(aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) (@fig-forest). Participants who preferred
buprenorphine were more likely to have ever received OAT with
burpenorphine (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX).

Participants who were currently receiving OAT and who preferred
methadone were more likely to have ever received OAT with methadone, and
had used heroin (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) and other pharmaceutical
opioids in the past month (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX) (@fig-forest).
Participants who preferred buprenorphine were more likely to have ever
received OAT with burpenorphine (aOR X.XX, 95%CI:X.XX, X.XX).
